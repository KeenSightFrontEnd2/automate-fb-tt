    Create an IFTTT Account:
        Go to IFTTT and sign up for an account if you don't have one.

    Connect Services:
        Connect your TikTok and Facebook Business accounts to IFTTT.
        In IFTTT, go to “Explore” and search for “TikTok” and “Facebook Pages” to connect them.

    Create Applets:
        Create an applet for TikTok: Set a trigger (e.g., new post in a Google Sheet) and an action (e.g., post to TikTok).
        Create an applet for Facebook Business: Set a similar trigger and an action to post to your Facebook Page.

Step 2: Using Google Sheets as an Intermediate Step

    Set Up Google Sheets:
        Create a Google Sheet where you’ll input your post content.
        Organize columns for the post text, image/video URL, and scheduled time.

    Create IFTTT Applets:
        Create an applet for each service (TikTok and Facebook Business) that triggers when a new row is added to the Google Sheet.

Step 3: Building a Dashboard

    Choose a Platform:
        Use a platform like Google Sheets or a custom web dashboard built with a service like Glide or Google App Script.

    Create a Form for Input:
        Design a form where you can input new post content, including text, images, and scheduled time.
        Ensure the form inputs data directly into the Google Sheet set up earlier.

Step 4: Automating the Posting Process

    Set Up Google App Scripts:
        Write scripts to handle time-based triggers if you want to schedule posts.

    Time-Based Trigger:
        Use Google Apps Script to automatically move the content from the input form to the appropriate row in the Google Sheet at the scheduled time.

Step 5: Monitoring and Managing Posts

    Use Google Sheets for Monitoring:
        Track all your posts in Google Sheets.
        Add columns for status (e.g., posted, pending) and any errors or feedback.

    Notifications:
        Set up email notifications or push notifications via IFTTT when a post is successfully made or if there are errors.

Example Workflow

    Input Post Content:
        Use the form on your dashboard to input post content and schedule time.
        The form data is saved into a Google Sheet.

    IFTTT Triggers:
        IFTTT monitors the Google Sheet for new rows.
        When a new row is added, IFTTT posts the content to TikTok and Facebook Business.

    Track and Manage:
        Check the Google Sheet to ensure posts are made successfully.
        Update the status column to keep track of posted content.
